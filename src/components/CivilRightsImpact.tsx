              Jackie Robinson's impact transcended sports. His dignified resistance to racism 
              and his refusal to accept second-class citizenship made him a symbol of the 
              Civil Rights Movement.

                After retiring from baseball in 1957, Robinson became even more active in the 
                struggle for equality. He worked with the NAACP, participated in the March on 
                Washington, and used his fame to advocate for civil rights legislation.

              <p>
                Robinson spoke out against discrimination, supported black-owned businesses, 
                and worked to create opportunities for African Americans in all areas of society. 
                His courage and determination inspired countless individuals to stand up against 
                injustice.
